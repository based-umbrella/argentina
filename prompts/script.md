# LKY's Original Gangster Moment - Script Concept

## Source Text

It is worth narrating an incident that took place during the first goodwill visit of a Singapore delegation in 1967, which is given in S R Nathan's book, "An Unexpected Journey: Path to Presidency".

The bilateral relations were still tentative. The centrepiece of the visit was the meeting of Lee and the Chinese Prime Minister Hua Guofeng. Hua presented Lee with a book, saying: "This is the correct account of the war between China and India. I hope you will find it useful."

Lee took the book, looked at the front cover, looked at the back, and said: "Prime Minister, this is your version of the war. There is another version, the Indian version. And in any case I am from Southeast Asia. It is nothing to do with us". He handed the book back.

Nathan has written, "For me, this was a very important moment, a clear confirmation that Lee Kuan Yew, ethnically Chinese, was his own man, in no way subordinate to China or the Chinese Communists."
