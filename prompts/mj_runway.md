### Runway Prompt:

The camera starts with a wide, vintage-style map of Southeast Asia, its muted greens and browns evoking an era of unrest. Slowly, it zooms in on Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia, where borders subtly pulse with an ominous red glow. As the camera focuses in, bold arrows—one red, one blue—move across the terrain, clashing at key points, representing the Cold War forces of communism and anti-communism. Text labels like "Domino Theory" and "Tet Offensive" fade in and out as political symbols of the USSR, USA, and China hover over their spheres of influence. Dramatic music swells, punctuated by subtle sound effects of marching and distant explosions, intensifying as small flashes mark key battles, capturing the region’s tense political atmosphere of the 1960s.
